Frequently asked questions by visitors in CNP:
When is the best time to visit?
The “sweet spot” is October to December for pleasant weather. For maximum wildlife sightings, late January to May is best because tall elephant grass is cut, improving visibility.

What are my chances of seeing a tiger?
Tigers are elusive. Even though CNP has a healthy population, the success rate is around 20–30%. Full-day jeep safaris during March–May offer the best chance.

Are there still wild elephants in the park?
Yes. Wild elephants exist but are fewer and more dangerous than rhinos. Most elephants seen by visitors are domestic, though wild bulls sometimes enter the park and nearby villages.

Do I really need a guide?
Yes. Hiring a guide is mandatory by law. Entry into the core jungle without an authorized guide is strictly prohibited.

How much is the entry fee?
As of 2026, the daily permit fee is NPR 2,000 for foreigners, NPR 1,000 for SAARC nationals, and NPR 150 for Nepali citizens.

Can I use the same permit for two days?
No. Permits are valid for one day only, from sunrise to sunset. A new permit is required for each day.

Is a jungle walk safe?
It is a calculated risk. Guides are trained, but animals like rhinos and sloth bears are unpredictable. Most visitors still find it thrilling and rewarding.

What should I wear inside the park?
Wear neutral colors such as khaki, olive, or brown. Avoid white, red, yellow, or bright colors as they attract attention and may provoke animals.

No. Entry into core areas is only allowed through authorized activities like jeep safaris, guided walks, canoeing, or elephant safaris.
